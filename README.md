&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an incoming Masters student in Psychology at the University of Toronto and Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest. 
  
### B. My research: 
       
* Goal: It is a task based fMRI study that tests 28 healhy young participants' long term memory recognition of highly similar scenes and correlate that with differential activation on the long-axis of the hippocampus (HPC) and neocrotical regions. 
       
* Current research: Neuroimaging research show that the posterior region of the hippocampus (Post-HPC) is associated with recollection of fine-grained local details; meanwhile the anterior region of the hippocampus (Ant-HPC) is associated with recollection of coarse global details.
 
* Hypotheses: We hypothesized that activation of the Post-HPC will be correlated with recognition accuracy of the many exemplars of a scene category, and the Ant-HPC will be correlated with recognition errors of generalizaing a scene category previously seen.
       
* Methodology: 
  * a. Behavioural - We use ePrime, a psychology presentation software, to present different exemplars of a scene        category, such as a bar, to participants at the Encoding (study phase) and then measure their recognition accuracy in responding "Old/Similar/New" to repeated, highly similar, and new scenes at Retrieval (test phase).

  * b. fMRI - We use a Siemens Prisma 3T Scanner and our design comprise of 8 runs of Study1,Test1, Study2,Test2, Anatomical, Study3,Test3, Study4,Test4. We use SPM8 and MatLab to preprocess and analyze our data.

## *II. BRAINHACK 2019*

### A. Dataset: 
I will use the DICOM data of one particpant from the above study.

### B. Tools: 
I wish to learn more about BIDS and fMRIPrep to organize and preprocess my data respectively. Subsequently, I wish to apply Nilearn to analyze my data for HPC ROI and whole brain analyses. Finally, I will use Jupyter to present my analyses.

### C. Deliverables: 
I hope to complete HPC ROI and whole brain analyses for one pilot participant.
  
### D. Medium: 
I hope to use Jupyter to present my analyses.
