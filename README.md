I. BACKGROUND
  
  A. Education: I am an incoming Masters student in Psychology at the University of Toronto and Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest. 
  
  B. My research: 
       
       1. Goal: It is a task based fMRI study that tests 28 healhy young participants' long term memory recognition of highly similar  
                scenes and correlate that with differential activation on the long-axis of the hippocampus (HPC) and neocrotical regions. 
       
       2. Current research: Neuroimaging research show that the posterior region of the hippocampus (Post-HPC) is associated with  
                            recollection of fine-grained local details; meanwhile the anterior region of the hippocampus (Ant-HPC) is 
                            associated with recollection of coarse global details.
 
       3. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that activation of the Post-HPC will be correlated with recognition accuracy of the many exemplars  
                      of a scene category, and the Ant-HPC will be correlated with recognition errors of generalizaing a scene category 
                      previously seen.
       
       4. Methodology - a. Behavioural - We use ePrime, a psychology presentation software, to present different exemplars of a scene 
                                         category, such as a bar, to participants at the Encoding (study phase) and then measure their   
                                         recognition accuracy in responding "Old/Similar/New" to repeated, highly similar, and new scenes  
                                         at Retrieval (test phase).

                        b. fMRI - We use a Siemens Prisma 3T Scanner and our design comprise of 8 runs of Study1,Test1, Study2,Test2, 
                                  Anatomical, Study3,Test3, Study4,Test4. We use SPM8 and MatLab to preprocess and analyze our data.
